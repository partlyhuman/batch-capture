# batch-capture

This is a commandline tool to grab correctly-cropped screenshots
of the same HTML element found in many copies of the same html file
in multiple subdirectories, and drop these shots in each directory.

### Installation

Run
 `npm install -g git:github.com/partlyhuman/batch-capture` 
from the command line.

### Usage

Run `batch-capture`, giving it options and a directory root 
to start looking for files in. You often use `.` for the current
directory.

Run with no arguments or `batch-capture --help` to see all available
options.
